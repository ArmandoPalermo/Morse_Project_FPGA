# 🔠 Morse Code Encoder/Decoder on FPGA

This repository contains the final project developed for the **Embedded and Electronic System** course. The project implements a **Morse code encoder and decoder** on an FPGA using hardware description languages (HDL) and simulation tools.

## 📘 Documentation

For a complete overview of the project, including design choices, implementation details, and results, refer to the following documents:
